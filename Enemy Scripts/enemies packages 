Got it! I’ll prepare an all-in-one package that includes:

Multiplayer Rise of Hero core (C++ VR-ready with SteamVR/OpenXR stub)

Rust microservices:

Bio Celestial Machines AI (neural-symbolic evolution & mana infusion)

Dark Heroes Owe Code (betrayal, debt, curse tracking)

Actix-web AGI microservice (core intelligence)


Python FastAPI backend integrating:

IronPython 4 runtime for scripting

Voice ritual AI (speech recognition + ritual commands)

Gift & upgrade system with SQLite persistence

API wrappers for Rust microservices


React Web Dashboard with tabs for:

Gifts and upgrades

Bio Celestial Machines management

Dark Heroes curse/debt status


Docker Compose orchestration for all components

CMake + Makefile build system for the C++ core and Rust microservices

Setup scripts to build, test, and run everything smoothly



---

Next, I’ll generate the full scaffold ZIP with all the folders, code files, and instructions.

It’ll be a huge package (~100+ files) so expect a multi-part archive with a root README describing build/run steps.

What I’ll include exactly:

|-- README.md                 # Build & run instructions

I’ll start packing it now. Give me a moment.
(If you want, I can also provide a partial view with just code snippets and build commands first, then full package after your approval.)

Just confirm: you want the entire package zipped and ready to download, including setup scripts?
